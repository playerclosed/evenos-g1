# Security policy for EvenOS‑G1

We take the security of EvenOS‑G1 seriously. If you discover a vulnerability or have security concerns, please follow these guidelines:

## Reporting a vulnerability

1. **Do not disclose security issues publicly.** Instead, send a private disclosure to the maintainers so that we can assess and remediate the issue before it is widely known.

2. Please submit a private security advisory through GitHub’s [security advisories system](https://github.com/playerclosed/evenos-g1/security/advisories/new), or if that is unavailable, email the maintainer using the contact information in the repository.

3. Include as much detail as possible: a description of the issue, steps to reproduce, potential impact, and any suggested fixes. The more information you can provide, the easier it will be for us to address the problem.

## Supported versions

EvenOS‑G1 is a prototype; there are no supported release lines yet. All versions should be considered under development. We will publish release notes and update this section as the project matures.

## Response process

Upon receiving a vulnerability report:

1. We will confirm receipt within three business days.
2. We will investigate the issue and attempt to reproduce it.
3. If the vulnerability is valid, we will prepare a fix and coordinate with you on the disclosure timeline.
4. After a fix is ready, we will publish an advisory and release a patched version.

Thank you for helping keep EvenOS‑G1 secure!
